Not just ‘Frontend’, are you a pro at web development with a special liking for JavaScript? How about working with a team that’s full of the creative breed and where food and outings are considered as being equally important to work?

We would love it if you are blessed with prudent design aesthetics but we would also want you to be game about having ‘fun’ while working. Welcome to the world of Give, where we have come together to introduce a culture of giving that aims to change lives for the better.

We are looking for determined front-end developers who come with a strong experience in implementing modern web UIs that prove to be are a delight for the user. If you think you have what it takes, build us this simple app in a frontend stack of your choosing.

### Objective
A simple video player app where user can request videos to be played in a queue by adding YouTube links

Sample UI below. The app doesn't need to have fancy design. We are looking for functional implementation.

### Tasks
- The application must be a SPA.
- The application should allow user to add a youtube link to the playlist and start playing from the playlist first in first out.

### Bonus

- Allow the user to remove and reorder items in the playlist.
- Sync different versions of the application. If the application is open across two tabs, both must be in sync for all activities. For e.g adding/removing/forwarding a video on any one, should update both of them.

### Instructions for Setup

- I have already deployed the website using Netlify. Please click [here](https://youtubeplayer.netlify.app/) for checking the live version. 
- For checking the code and running it in local kindly Clone the Repo and open cmd.exe from the repo folder(Where package.json is present).
