## Tasks List

[✔] The application should allow user to add a youtube link to the playlist and start playing songs from the playlist first in first out.
[✔] Once a song is finished, it should be removed from the playlist.
[✔] The youtube link must be validated by the app for proper url format before adding to the queue.
## Bonus
[✔] Allow the user to remove and reorder items in the playlist.
[✔] Sync different versions of the application. If the application is open across two tabs, both must be in sync for all activities.
