## to install 
To install the application use npm install in the main directory

After that to run the application use npm start

### Tasks
- The application must be a SPA.
- The application should allow user to add a youtube link to the playlist and start playing songs from the playlist first in first out.
- Once a song is finished, it should be removed from the playlist.
- The youtube link must be validated by the app for proper url format before adding to the queue.

### Bonus

- Allow the user to remove and reorder items in the playlist.(User Remove is implemented and reorder is not implemented)
- Sync different versions of the application. If the application is open across two tabs, both must be in sync for all activities. For e.g adding/removing/forwarding a song on any one, should update both of them.(If the user opens a new tab the copy of the existing is created sync is not implemented)

### Deliverables
