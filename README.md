We are looking for determined front-end developers who come with a strong experience in implementing modern web UIs that prove to be are a delight for the user. If you think you have what it takes, build us this simple app in a frontend stack of your choosing.

### Objective
A simple Radio app where user can listen to already requested songs by other and request songs to be played by adding YouTube links

Sample UI below. The app doesn't need to have fancy design. We are looking for functional implementation.

### Tasks
- The application must be a SPA.
- The application should allow user to add a youtube link to the playlist and start playing songs from the playlist first in first out.
- Once a song is finished, it should be removed from the playlist.
- The youtube link must be validated by the app for proper url format before adding to the queue.

### Bonus

- Allow the user to remove and reorder items in the playlist.
- Sync different versions of the application. If the application is open across two tabs, both must be in sync for all activities. For e.g adding/removing/forwarding a song on any one, should update both of them.

### Deliverables
- Create a fork of this repository
- Code your solution in a frontend stack of your choice
- Include instructions on how to set it up and run in the README.md
- Add your resume and other profile / project links
- Submit a pull request (PR)
