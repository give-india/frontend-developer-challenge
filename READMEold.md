We are looking for determined front-end developers who come with a strong experience in implementing modern web UIs that prove to be are a delight for the user. If you think you have what it takes, build us this simple app in a frontend stack of your choosing.

### Objective
A simple video player app where user can request videos to be played in a queue by adding YouTube links

Sample UI below. The app doesn't need to have fancy design. We are looking for functional implementation.

### Tasks
- The application must be a SPA.
- The application should allow user to add a youtube link to the playlist and start playing from the playlist first in first out.
- Once a video is finished, it should be removed from the playlist.
- The youtube link must be validated by the app for proper url format before adding to the queue.

### Bonus

- Allow the user to remove and reorder items in the playlist.
- Sync different versions of the application. If the application is open across two tabs, both must be in sync for all activities. For e.g adding/removing/forwarding a video on any one, should update both of them.

### Deliverables
- Create a fork of this repository
- Code your solution in a frontend stack of your choice
- Include instructions on how to set it up and run in the README.md
- Add your resume and other profile / project links
- Submit a pull request (PR)
