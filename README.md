We are looking for determined front-end developers who come with a strong experience in implementing modern web UIs that prove to be are a delight for the user. If you think you have what it takes, build us this simple app in a frontend stack of your choosing.

### Objective
A simple Radio app where user can listen to already requested songs by other and request songs to be played by adding YouTube links

### Tasks
- The application must be a SPA.
- The application should fetch the current playlist from the provided REST API and start playing songs from the playlist.
- Once a song is finished, it should be removed from the playlist.
- The user should be able to add a YouTube link, which must be validated by the app.
- The app should then fetch basic information about the link like title, thumbnail and duration and add it to the playlist.
- The playlist must be synced to the server using the provided REST API.

### Bonus

- Allow user to search youtube instead of just providing a url to YouTube video
- Sync different versions of the application. If the application is open across two tabs or two different computers, both must be in sync for all activities. For e.g adding/removing/forwarding a song on any one, should update both of them.

### Deliverables
- Create a fork of this repository
- Code your solution in a frontend stack of your choice
- Include instructions on how to set it up and run in the README.md
- Add your resume and other profile / project links **(Don't include your social profiles. We really don't care unless it's your steam profile.)**
- Submit a pull request (PR)
